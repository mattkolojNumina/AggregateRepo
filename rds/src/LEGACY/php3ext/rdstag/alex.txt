To use extensions on your OS, you will need to recompile PHP.
You need to edit the Makefile in the php3 directory and add  
-rdynamic to the start of the LDFLAGS line at the top of the 
Makefile.  Then type: 'make clean; make'                      
You can still go ahead and build the extensions now by typing
'make' in this directory.  They just won't work correctly    
until you recompile your PHP.                                
If you are compiling php as a module, you should also add    
-rdynamic to the start of the EXTRA_LDFLAGS in Apache       
Configuration file.  Note that if you are using the APACI    
build mechanism you should make this change in the           
Configuration.tmpl file instead.
